# Data Carpentry Learners' Repository

Welcome! This repository contains learning materials for the Data Carpentry workshops organized by Leiden University, TU Delft, Erasmus University, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Here you will find notes, resources, and type-along logs to support your learning during the workshop. This GitHub repository is like a shared folder where your instructors will upload and update code and materials as the lessons progress.



## Live Notes from R lessons
This repository follows the same structure as the RStudio project created by your instructor during the workshop.

To find the files you need to do one of the following:


1. In the file list above, click the folder with the name of the R project (likely called `data-carpentry`).
2. Open the file the instructor is currently working in:

  - **Day 1:** 
     - [intro-r.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/intro-r.R)
     - [starting-data.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/starting-data.R)
  - **Day 2:** 
     - [data-wrangling.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/data-wrangling.R)
     - [awesome-report.Rmd](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/documents/awesome-report.Rmd)
