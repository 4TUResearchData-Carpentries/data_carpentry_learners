# Data Carpentry Learners' Repository

Welcome! This repository contains learning materials for the Data Carpentry workshops organized by Leiden University, TU Delft, Erasmus University, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Here you will find notes, resources, and type-along logs to support your learning during the workshop. This GitHub repository is like a shared folder where your instructors will upload and update code and materials as the lessons progress.



## Live Notes from R lessons
This repository follows the same structure as the RStudio project created by your instructor during the workshop.

To find the files you need to do one of the following:


1. In the file list above, click the folder with the name of the R project (likely called `data-carpentry`).
2. Open the file the instructor is currently working in:

  - **Day 1:** 
     - [intro-r.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/intro-r.R)
     - [starting-data.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/starting-data.R)
  - **Day 2:** 
     - [data-wrangling.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/data-wrangling.R)
     - [awesome-report.Rmd](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/documents/awesome-report.Rmd)


> üí°**Tip:** Not seeing the most recent lines of code? Try refreshing the page ‚Äî new commands will appear as they're saved!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: GitHub only shows folders that have at least one file inside. Even if you don't see a folder in the notes, you still need to create it, as showed by the instructor.

## Other materials

###
If you haven't done so already, you can [**download the data**](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/raw/refs/heads/main/extra_resources/data/data-carpentry.zip) needed for the workshop form the repository.


## Make sure you're on the right branch
GitHub repositories can have multiple **branches** ‚Äî each one can represent a different version of the workshop.
You're currently viewing the **`2025-07-01-ldev-delft`** branch, which corresponds to the workshop starting on **1 July 2025** at TU Delft.
If you're unsure whether you're on the right branch, ask an instructor or helper for guidance.
