# Data Carpentry Learners' Repository

Welcome to the Learner resources for Data Carpentry workshops hosted by the consortium of Leiden University, TU Delft, Erasmus University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Here you will find a repository of notes, resources and type-along logs that support your learning in the Data Carpentries course.


## Live Notes from R lessons
The repository should mimic the project structure of the `R` project that has been created by the instructors during the Data Carpentry.  To find needed files, you can:
- In the files list above, go to a folder icon with the name of the project that the instructor has created. This folder is likely called `data-carpentry`.
- Go to the file in which the instructor is now coding:
  - **Day 1:** 
     - [intro-r.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/intro-r.R)
     - [starting-data.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/starting-data.R)
  - **Day 2:** 
     - [data-wrangling.R](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/scripts/data-wrangling.R)
     - [awesome-report.Rmd](https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/data_carpentry_learners/blob/2025-07-01-ldev-delft/data-carpentry/documents/awesome-report.Rmd)


> üí°**Tip:** You don't see the most recent lines of code? Refresh the page and see the new commands coming in!

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: you will only see non-empty folders. You still need to create folders to follow the workshop smoothly.




Please ensure that you are looking at the correct **branch** of this repository for the particular version of the course that you are attending. If in doubt, check with the instructor or a helper.

Right now you are looking at the **2025-07-01-ldev-delft** branch, which is corresponds to the course at TU Delft starting on **1 July 2025**.
