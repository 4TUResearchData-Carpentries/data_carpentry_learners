# Data Carpentry Learners' Repository

Welcome to the Learner resources for Data Carpentry workshops hosted by the consortium of Leiden University, TU Delft, Erasmus University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Here you will find a repository of notes, resources and type-along logs that support your learning in the Data Carpentries course.

Please ensure that you are looking at the correct **branch** of this repository for the particular version of the course that you are attending. If in doubt, check with the instructor or a helper.

Right now you are looking at the **2025-02-10-ldev-leidn** branch, which is for the run of the course on 10 February 2025, at Leiden University.
